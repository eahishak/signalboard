<!-- Setup Instructions -->

Hey! Quick guide to get everything running.

First, add these CSS files to your HTML head:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="advanced.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mobile-responsive.css" />

Then add the JavaScript files right before your closing body tag:

<script src="app.js"></script>
<script src="analytics.js"></script>
<script src="animations.js"></script>
<script src="integration.js"></script>
<script src="mobile-enhancements.js"></script>
<script src="demo.js"></script>

That's basically it. The integration script handles connecting everything.


Complete HTML Structure
-----------------------

Your head section should look like:

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>CaloCount Pro</title>
  
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
  
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="advanced.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="mobile-responsive.css" />
</head>

And your scripts before closing body:

  <script src="app.js"></script>
  <script src="analytics.js"></script>
  <script src="animations.js"></script>
  <script src="integration.js"></script>
  <script src="mobile-enhancements.js"></script>
  <script src="demo.js"></script>
</body>


What You Get
------------

Once you load the page, you'll have:

- Dashboard with calorie tracking
- AI meal scanner using your camera
- History page with all your meals
- Plans to set nutrition goals
- Analytics with charts and predictions
- Profile settings with picture upload

On mobile you'll see:
- Bottom nav bar
- Top header
- Swipe gestures work
- Pull down to refresh
- Floating camera button


Testing It Works
----------------

Open your browser console. You should see messages like:

CaloCount Pro initialized successfully!
Advanced Analytics Module Loaded
Advanced Animations Module Loaded
Mobile Enhancements Module Loaded

Try this in console:
demo.loadData()

That puts in 2 weeks of sample meals so you can see the charts populate.

For a full demo:
demo.comprehensive()


Troubleshooting
---------------

Charts not showing?
Make sure analytics.js loaded before integration.js

Mobile nav missing?
Check mobile-enhancements.js is included

Profile picture upload broken?
Same thing - need mobile-enhancements.js

Animations not working?
animations.js needs to be there


Customizing Colors
------------------

Open style.css and look for the :root section at the top. Change these:

--primary-600: #6366f1;
--secondary-600: #8b5cf6;

Pick whatever colors you want.


File Checklist
--------------

Make sure you have all these in your project folder:

index.html
style.css
advanced.css
mobile-responsive.css
app.js
analytics.js
animations.js
integration.js
mobile-enhancements.js
demo.js

That's 10 files total for the app to work properly.


Browser Support
---------------

Works on:
Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
iOS Safari
Android Chrome
Pretty much any modern browser from the last couple years


Performance Tips
----------------

The app is already optimized but if you want it faster:

- Images are lazy loaded by default
- Animations use requestAnimationFrame
- Charts render with canvas (faster than SVG)
- LocalStorage caching for everything

Should run smooth on any device.


Development Mode
----------------

When you're testing, keep the console open. Any errors will show up there.

The demo.js file has a bunch of test functions:

demo.stats() - shows app statistics
demo.export() - downloads your data as JSON
demo.particles() - tests particle effects
demo.confetti() - celebration animation
demo.analytics() - switches to analytics view

Useful for making sure everything works.


Mobile Testing
--------------

Easiest way is to resize your browser window below 768px width. Or use Chrome DevTools device toolbar.

Real device testing:
1. Put files on a local server
2. Access from your phone's browser
3. Test gestures and touches

Pull-to-refresh only works on real touch devices, not mouse simulation.


Going Live
----------

Since there's no backend, you can just upload all the files to any static host:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Regular web hosting

Upload the 10 core files plus any docs you want. Done.


Common Issues
-------------

"Nothing happens when I click save"
- Check app.js loaded
- Look for console errors

"Analytics page is blank"
- You need some meal data first
- Run demo.loadData()

"Mobile bottom nav doesn't show"
- Window width needs to be under 768px
- Check mobile-responsive.css loaded


"Profile picture won't upload"
- mobile-enhancements.js required
- Check file size (5MB limit)
